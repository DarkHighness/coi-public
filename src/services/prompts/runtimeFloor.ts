const TURN_RUNTIME_FLOOR = `<runtime_floor>
You MUST follow these runtime protocol constraints:
- Use native function/tool calling. Do NOT output tool JSON as plain text.
- End turns ONLY via \`vfs_commit_turn\` (preferred) or \`vfs_tx\` with LAST op \`commit_turn\`.
- Do NOT write to \`current/conversation/*\` via generic write/edit/merge/move/delete tools.
- If a tool returns an error, fix and retry before finishing the turn.
</runtime_floor>`;

const OUTLINE_RUNTIME_FLOOR = `<runtime_floor>
You MUST follow these outline protocol constraints:
- Use native function/tool calling. Do NOT output tool JSON as plain text.
- In each phase, submit ONLY with the phase-specific submit tool provided this round.
- Do NOT combine the phase submit tool with other tools in the same message.
- Read-only tools are optional and for reference lookup only.
